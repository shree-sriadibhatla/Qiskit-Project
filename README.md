# Qiskit Project - Quantum TSP for Climate Action

A quantum computing project using IBM's Qiskit framework, featuring a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) solver that optimizes routes to minimize carbon emissions and support climate action.

## üåç Climate Action Focus

This project addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action** by:
- Minimizing fuel consumption in transportation and logistics
- Reducing carbon emissions through optimal route planning
- Supporting sustainable transportation with electric vehicle optimization
- Demonstrating quantum computing's potential for environmental solutions

## Setup

1. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Examples

### Hello Quantum World
```bash
python hello_quantum.py
```

This script demonstrates:
- Creating quantum circuits
- Bell state (quantum entanglement)
- Single qubit operations (superposition)
- Running simulations with Qiskit Aer

### Quantum TSP for Climate Action
```bash
python quantum_tsp.py
```

This script demonstrates:
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for TSP
- Carbon emission calculations for different vehicle types
- Route optimization for minimal environmental impact
- Visualization of optimal routes
- Climate impact metrics and savings

### Quick TSP Demo
```bash
python demo_tsp.py
```

A simplified demo showing:
- 3-city TSP optimization
- Vehicle type comparison (electric vs hybrid vs gasoline)
- Carbon savings calculations
- Environmental impact metrics

## What You'll See

### Hello Quantum World
1. A quantum circuit diagram
2. Measurement results from quantum simulations
3. Examples of quantum entanglement and superposition

### Quantum TSP
1. Optimal route calculations for 4 California cities
2. Carbon emission comparisons between vehicle types
3. Route visualizations showing the most efficient paths
4. Environmental impact metrics (trees equivalent, home power days)
5. Climate action insights and recommendations

## Key Features

- **Climate-Aware Optimization**: Routes optimized for minimal carbon emissions
- **Multi-Vehicle Support**: Electric, hybrid, and gasoline vehicle comparisons
